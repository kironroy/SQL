## Notes

Log File: Data goes here before going into actual database. 

- Log file acts as a backup
- Over time, the file expands
- Needs to be maintained

For development, keep Recovery Model set to simple.
- Makes the application perform better, keep the file size down. 

```Ctrl + R``` = open a run box

```Ctrl + N``` = query window

```Alt + X``` = run a script

## Three Concepts 
- **Tables**
- **Views**
- **Stored Procedures**

---

- **Tables**: Store information.

- **Views**: Combine information, easier to consume.

- **Stored Procedures**: Access and update information. Much more secure.
